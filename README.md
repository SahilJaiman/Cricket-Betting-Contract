# Cricket-Betting-Contract
This is a Tezos based cricket betting smart contract built using SmartPy. It allows users to place bets on winning teams in a cricket match. The match events are added by an admin, and users can place bets on their preferred team. The admin then resolves the bets, and the users who bet correctly receive a proportion of the funds from the losing bets. The contract is transparent and secure, ensuring fairness in the betting process.
